Hi, I'm Jerell. I haven't decided which of my notes to publish so there's not much here yet.

I'm a software engineer with [[/work history/index|experience]] using a variety of languages, including TypeScript, Julia, C#, Rust, Go, and Python.

I've recently started writing shaders and learning zig. I'm currently reading a book on compilers
